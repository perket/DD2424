## Assignment 1-3
In assignment 1-3 a network where trained using mini-batch gradient descent, with different complexity (low complexity in assignment 1 and higher through assignment 2 and 3). The network where trained to classify images and got better as the network complexity got higher.

## Assignment 4
A recurent neural network where trained to determine the next character in a text, based on a part of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Since it did only guess characters and not words the results wasn't that good and most of the "words" didn't mean anything. However it evolved and produced significantly better guesses after some training than before training. 

All code in the assignments are written by me.
